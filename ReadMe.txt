Final Project

Instructions to run the code: 

After unzipping the folder, maintain the directory as it is. You may remove any directories within this directory if you want to start
afresh. You can remove data_profile.pdf to see the python code in action as well. The requirements for this project are

imbalanced_learn==0.12.0
matplotlib==3.8.2
numpy==1.24.1
pandas==1.5.3
reportlab==4.0.9
scikit_learn==1.3.2
scipy==1.12.0
shap==0.45.0
statsmodels==0.14.1

Once you have installed the above packages, navigate to this directory by using terminal or something similar and type:

python3 main.py

This will run all of the code required. main.py is the driver code that utilizes code in the other files to perform the
appropriate tasks. The other files contain helper functions for main.py to run and do not need to be called manually to
run the code. Estimated run time is dependent on CPU specs.
